# job-hunt

This is a tiny project designed to open several searches on job sites more easily. It is setup to run on launch, so that whenever I open my laptop I check if there are any new, relevant job postings. The early bird gets the worm, after all

I gave up on using Python. Since I don't need to manipulate the sites, just open urls, using Powershell is much faster
